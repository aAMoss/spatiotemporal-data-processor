# spatiotemporal-data-processor
Tools to parse spatiotemporal data (such as event image data) for 
classification by Tsetlin Machines.

There exist many types of event-based (spatiotemporal) data. That
data can come in many file types and formats.

Building on the work I've been doing with my Event Image Data 
Processor, I would like to create a toolset that is able to parse 
all kinds of spatiotemporal data for Tsetlin Machines- not just 
event image data.

Lots to do first, so just watch this space.
